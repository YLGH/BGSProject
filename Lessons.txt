Lesson on Method of Steepest Descent <- Machine learning for estimating the residual along one line . Have them measure the slope of the tangent or just draw best fit line and find equation of it

lab that has them hit it really hard and investigate TDOA is constant
Investigate velocity of thing in medium
	data collections/error estimations

#Provide all C code

Maybe skeleton of python

Lesson on pythagorean theorem and distances in cartesian 

Lesson on velocity, time distance relation

Worksheets 

——————————————

Data collection from sensors
Ask about what does hardware do

Talk about general earthquake info s vs p wave

—————————————————
Brief python lessons that will teach them how to write basic functions/variables etc
amount of copy pasta needing decreases for each lesson: in situ

^ included at the end of each lesson 

————————————————
Lab that makes them find velocity in various mediums (metal, wood, plastic, glass, others?)

—————————————————————
Reading from sensors
